    <p>This product allows a listing agent to enter the MLS number, address, and compensation amount immediately after listing the property. This eliminates having to answer hundreds of calls/text messages from buyer's agents which gives us all more time to concentrate on our clients and making money.</p>
    <p>Initial setup is easy. Licensed agents will be required to put their name and license number into the system. After that, Listing agents will be able to log in and list an unlimited number of their listings along with the cooperating brokerage compensation for each of their listings.</p>
    <p>Buyer's agents will also be required to register in order to access this vital information. Simply enter the MLS number and/or the property address that you want to show.</p>
    <p>The more agents we have signed up, the better off we will all be. So, tell your brokers and realtor friends. We are all trying to work together for a common goal to make our lives easier as Realtors. Let's DO THIS!</p>
